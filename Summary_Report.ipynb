Objective:  \\n \\n1.1. To   solicit   public   comments   /   views on the changes proposed regarding \\nfees and expenses charged by AMCs to unitholders of mutual fund schemes, \\nunder Regulation 52 of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regul ations, 1996 (“MF \\nRegulations”) to facilitate greater transparency and accrual of benefits  of \\neconomies of scale to investors.  \\n \\n2. Background and need for review:  \\n \\n2.1. In 2012, SEBI had reviewed the provisions  relating to fees and expenses \\ncharged by Mutual Funds. Pursuant to the review, the following regulatory  \\nchanges were inter-alia implemented (the industry Asset Under Management \\n(“AUM”) was approx. INR 6 lakh crore ) –  \\n2.1.1.  Introduction of direct plan ;  \\n2.1.2.  Fungibility in Total Expense Ratio (TER) within existing slabs;  \\n2.1.3.  Four a dditional expenses (over and above the TER limits); and   \\n2.1.4.  Setting aside 2 basis points on daily net assets by AMCs for investor \\neducation and awareness initiatives.   \\n \\n2.2. Thereafter, another review was carried out in FY 2018 -19, wherein, some \\nadditional policy measures were introduced (the industry AUM was approx. INR \\n21 lakh crore ), which included –  \\n2.2.1.  Review of TER slabs,  \\n2.2.2.  Additional expenses for net inflows from B -30 citie s (beyond top 30 cities) \\n(instead of B -15 cities)   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 2 \\n \\n2.2.3.  Additional expense to the extent of 5 bps (instead of 20 bps) in schemes \\nhaving provision of exit load ; and  \\n2.2.4.  Full trail commission  model . \\n \\n2.3. The AUM of the industry has increased almost twofold since the last review in \\nthe FY 2018 -19 to approx. INR 39  lakh crore  on March 31, 2023 . \\n \\n2.4. As an ongoing exercise to  increase transparency and to  continuously align \\nregulatory provisions to reflect the market dynamics and their impact on \\ninvestors’ interest, SEBI had once again initiated a study of existing regulatory \\nprovisions relating to fees and expenses in mutual fund scheme vis-à-vis \\nmarket practices.  \\n \\n2.5. Based on the detailed study and findings from onsite and offsite inspections of \\nMutual Funds , a need has been felt for further streamlining of provisions \\nrelating to TER and therefore the matter was placed before the Mutual Fund \\nAdvisory Committee (“MFAC”) in January 2023.  Considering the deliberations \\nin MFAC  members  (comprising of AMCs, Stock Exchanges, Association of \\nMutual Funds in India (AMFI), Independent Trustees of Mutual Funds, market \\nexperts, Registrar and Share Transfer Agents (RTAs) and other stakeholders ) \\nand internal analysis , comments are being sought under the succeeding \\nparagraphs.  \\n \\n3. Existing Regulatory Framework  (Scheme Based) : \\n \\n3.1. Presently, a slab based TER is applicable for various  categories of schemes \\nviz, Equity Schemes, Debt Schemes, Hybrid Schemes and Solution Oriented \\nSchemes.   The existing slab -wise TER limits for open ended equity ori ented \\nand other than equity -oriented schemes are as provided below:  \\nBase TER  \\nAUM Slab (In INR Crore)  TER limits for Equity \\nOriented Schemes  TER limits for other than \\nequity -oriented \\nschemes  \\n1st INR 500 Crores of the daily net assets  2.25%  2.00%   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 3 \\n \\nBase TER  \\nAUM Slab (In INR Crore)  TER limits for Equity \\nOriented Schemes  TER limits for other than \\nequity -oriented \\nschemes  \\nNext INR 250 crores of the daily net assets  2.00%  1.75%  \\nNext INR  1,250 crores of the daily net assets  1.75%  1.50%  \\nNext INR  3,000 crores of the daily net assets  1.60%  1.35%  \\nNext INR  5,000 crores of the daily net assets  1.50%  1.25%  \\nOn the next INR  40,000 crores of the daily net \\nassets  Total Expense ratio reduction of  0.05% for every increase \\nof INR  5,000 crores of daily net assets or part thereof.  \\nOn the balance of the assets  1.05%  0.80%  \\n \\n3.2. The TER limits for the schemes other than above are as detailed below:  \\nSr. No  Particulars  Max. TER  \\n1 Index Fund/schemes and Exchange Traded Funds  1.00%  \\n2 Fund of Fund  \\n Investment in Liquid fund, Index Fund or ETFs  1.00%  \\nEquity Oriented Schemes  2.25%  \\nOther than equity oriented schemes  2.00%  \\n3 Close ended and Interval Schemes  \\n Equity Oriented Scheme(s)  1.25%  \\nOther than equity oriented scheme(s)  1.00%  \\n \\n3.3. Mutual Fund schemes are currently permitted to charge following four \\nadditional expenses which are over and above the expense limits specified \\nabove:  \\ni. Brokerage and transaction costs which are incurred for the purpose of \\nexecution of trade up to 0.12 per cent of trade value in case of cash market \\ntransactions and 0.05 per cent of trade value in case of derivatives \\ntransactions.  \\nii. Expenses not exceed ing of 0.30 per cent of daily net assets , subject to \\nnew inflows from B -30 cities.  \\niii. Additional expenses not exceeding 0.05 per cent of daily net assets for the \\nschemes having provision of exit load.   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 4 \\n \\niv. Goods and Services Tax on investment and a dvisory fees charged by \\nMutual F unds /AMCs to the scheme.  \\n \\n3.4. Apart from the above, AMCs are permitted to deduct transaction charges of \\nINR 100/- for existing investors in a mutual fund and INR 150/- for first time \\ninvestor in mutual fund per subscription of INR 10,000/ - and above from the \\nsubscription amount of the investor.  The amount deduced as transaction \\ncharges is paid to the distributor.  \\n \\n3.5. Further, investors can directly pay upfront commission to distributors based on \\nhis assessment of various factors incl uding the service rendered by the \\ndistributor.  \\n \\n4. Study analysis  \\nAs a part of the  detailed study of the prevalent practices in the industry relating to \\nthe business as well as  fees and expenses being charged, relevant data was \\ncollected from all the Mutual Funds. A summary of data analysis carried out is as \\nunder:  \\n \\nGrowth of the Mutual Fund ind ustry  \\n \\n4.1. During the period from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2023 , while there was a \\nthree -fold increase in movement of Nifty 50 ( from 5 ,296 to 17,359 ), the Mutual \\nFund Industry witnessed a n over  six-fold increase in its AUM from approx. INR \\n6 lakh crores to approx. INR 39 lakh Crores.  \\n \\n4.2. The number of unique investors as on March 31, 2023 (3.77 Crores) was 2.94  \\ntimes the number of unique investors as on March 31, 2017 (1.28 Crores).  \\nSimilarly, number of total folios as on  March 31, 2023 (14.57  Crores) was 2.63 \\ntimes the number of folios as on March 31, 2017 (5.53 Crores).   \\n \\n4.3. The above data reflects that apart f rom the market movement , the increase in \\nAUM of Mutual Fund industry may be attributed to increase in new  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 5 \\n \\ninvestments /inflows  during  the last five years. The TER is based on the total \\nAUM including both these components.  \\n \\nInvestment Patterns  \\n4.4. A break -up of investors’ contribution to the industry AUM  during the FY 2017 -\\n2023  and investment preferences of individual s and corporate investors, who \\nare the major investors in Mutual Fund industry, as on March 31 , 2023 , was as \\nunder:  \\n \\n \\n \\n4.5. As can be seen from the above, t he investments by indi vidual investors has \\ngrown by 180 % (from INR 8.43 lakh crore to INR 2 3.67 lakh crore ) and that of \\ncorporates has grown by 77 % (from INR 8.68 lakh crore  to INR 1 5.40 lakh \\ncrore ) between March 31, 2017 to  March 31 , 2023.    \\n \\n4.6. The study further shows that the  share of retail individual investors has \\nincreased from 19.06% of the tota l AUM as on March 31, 2017 to 25 .55% of \\nthe total AUM as on March 31 , 202 3.  Similarly, the share of  HNI individual \\n0510152025\\nMarch 31,\\n2017March 31,\\n2018March 31,\\n2019March 31,\\n2020March 31,\\n2021March 31,\\n2022March 31,\\n2023Investors Contribution to Industry AUM (In INR Lakh Crores)\\nCorp.

Thus, share of individual investors \\nwas 60.06% as on March 31, 2023  and the remaining investment is of \\ncorporate investors, banks and financial Institutions, FIIs etc.,  \\n \\n4.7. Corporate s have majo rity of their investment i.e. 5 1.75% of investment s in Debt \\nSchemes and 2 8.94% of their investment in Exchange Traded Funds ( ETFs ).  \\nRemaining 19 .30% of the ir investment  is seen to be  in Hybrid schemes, \\nSolution oriented schemes,  Index fund,  Fund of Funds etc.  \\n \\n4.8. Individual inve stors have invested more than 57.18 % of their investment in \\nequity schemes and 1 7.49% in Hybrid Schemes.  Remain ing 2 5.33% of their \\ninvestment is in Debt schemes, ETFs and other schemes like Index fund, \\nSolution oriented schemes, Fund of Funds etc.  \\n \\n4.9. The weighted average TER charged by the regular plan of  different types  of \\nopen ended schemes  and ETFs during FY 2021 -22 is as given below:  \\n \\nSr. \\nNo. Scheme Type  Weighted Average TER \\nexcluding additional \\nexpenses (Base TER) of \\nRegular Plan  Weighted Average TER \\nincluding additional \\nexpenses  (Total TER) of \\nRegular Plan  \\n1 Debt Schemes  0.71%  0.77%  \\n2 Equity Schemes  1.61%  2.00%  \\n3 Hybrid Schemes  1.45%  1.88%  \\n4 ETFs  0.08%  0.11%  \\n \\n4.10.  Following are the observations from the above data:  \\ni. Despite presence of various Mutual Funds with significantly large AUMs  in \\nschemes which are oriented towards retail investors i.e. Equity and Hybrid \\nschemes , the TER charged is mostly close to the prescribed regulatory limits. \\nHowever, in case of Debt schemes , with investors being mostly corporates/ \\ninstitutional investors having bargaining power, the TER is much lower than \\nthe prescribed limit .  Therefore , the benefit of economies of scale accruing in  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 7 \\n \\nthe debt schemes appears to be passed on to the investors but not so in the \\nEquity and Hybrid schemes .  \\n \\nii. The weighted average  TERs for Debt schemes and ETFs  (schemes with  \\nmajorly corporate s as inves tors) are much lower in comparison to the \\nregulatory limit s as well as weighted average TERs of Equity and Hybrid \\nschemes  (schemes with mostly individual s as investors) .  \\n \\n4.11.  As mentioned at para 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 , the regulatory limits of TER are specified \\nfor Mutual Fund schemes . Further, a dditional expenses such as brokerage and \\ntransaction cost, incentive for B30 investments etc. over and above the TER \\nlimits, are also permitted to be charged to unitholders. In this regard, a \\ncomparative analysis was carr ied out on the weighted average base TER and \\nactual total TER that is charged to unitholders of  open ended Equity schemes  \\nduring FY 2021 -22.

Considering that there is no upper cap on additional expenses, the actual \\nexpense to investor is considerably higher tha n the prescribed base TER limits \\nfor Regular Plan (as seen in column G above ).  It can be seen from the above \\ndata that the cost of investment (including all additional expenses) for direct plan \\nis well below t he regulatory limits.  \\n \\nFinancial Data  \\n \\n4.13.  As the books of accounts are prepared at entity level i.e. AMC level and not \\nactivity level, the data with respect to revenue and profit before tax pertaining to \\nMutual Fund operations  were submitted to SEBI by AMCs, based on certain \\nassumptions. In view of the same and for the sake of uniformity, data regarding \\nrevenue and profits at AMC level has been considered for the study and analysis.  \\n \\n4.14.  Further, for the purpose of analysis, 42 Mutu al Funds were  categorized based \\non their AUMs as on March 31, 2022, as under:  \\n \\ni. Large MFs/AMCs - Mutual Funds having more than 5% share of industry \\nAUM  \\nii. Medium MFs/AMCs - Mutual Funds with 1% to 5% share of industry AUM  \\niii. Small MFs/AMCs - Mutual Funds which had  upto 1% share of industry AUM  \\n \\n4.15.  As per the data, the percentage share of industry AUM as on March 31, 2022 is \\nas under:  \\n \\n \\n \\n Sr. No.  AMC Size  No. of Mutual Funds  % of t otal industry AUM  \\n1 Large AMCs  8 74.53%  \\n2 Medium AMCs  10 20.76%  \\n3 Small AMCs  24 4.71%   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 9 \\n \\n \\n4.16.  The available data shows that while consolidated revenue of the industry has \\nincreased by 55.27% from INR 11,397 crores to appr ox. INR 17,697 crores in a \\nspan of 5 years, the figures for profits before tax (PBT) at industry level increased \\nby 154% duri ng the said period.  The increase in AMC’s financials can be \\nattributed to the economies of scale which the AMCs have achieved with \\ntremendous increase in AUM  during the above period.  \\n \\n4.17.  The AMC level (including P ortfolio Management Services  and other activities) \\nconsolidated data for PBT and PBT margin of Large, Medium and Small AMCs \\nfor the period from FY 2016 -17 to FY 2021 -22 is as under:  \\n \\nYear  Large  Medium  Small  \\nNet PBT of \\nthe AMC  \\n(INR \\nCrore)  PBT Margin \\nof AMCs \\n(PBT / Total \\nRevenue ) Net PBT \\nof the \\nAMC  \\n(INR \\nCrore)  PBT Margin \\nof AMCs \\n(PBT/ Total \\nRevenue ) Net PBT \\nof the \\nAMC  \\n(INR \\nCrore)  PBT \\nMargin of \\nAMCs \\n(PBT/ Total \\nRevenue ) \\n2016 -17 3,296 43.40%  835 31.45%  171 14.95%  \\n2017 -18 4,370 43.59%  1,290 36.99%  295 17.57%  \\n2018 -19 5,332 49.54%  1,285 36.59%  331 20.63%  \\n2019 -20 6,038 61.87%  1,114 38.15%  92 6.55%  \\n2020 -21 7,282 71.01%  1,226 42.90%  567 33.01%  \\n2021 -22 8,598 70.13%  1,751 50.23%  592 30.33%  \\n \\n4.18.  The following is  further  observed from the data on revenue, PBT and PBT \\nmargins of AMCs : \\n \\ni. There is  an increase of  173% and 93.25% in the profits made by Large AMCs \\nand Medium AMCs respectively , during the period between FY 2016 -17 and \\nFY 2021 -22.  \\nii. While 3 Medium AMCs turned from loss to profit making entities during the \\nperiod from FY 2016 -17 to FY 2021 -22, all Large and Medium AMCs were in \\nprofit in FY 2021 -22.  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 10 \\n \\niii. At an aggregate level, the data indicates that the PBT for  Small AMCs also \\ngrew except in FY 2019 -20.  However, 12 of the 24 small AMCs had incurred \\nlosses during FY 2019 -20 and FY 2020 -21.  The number of loss making Small \\nAMCs has since reduced to 10 in FY 2021 -22.  5 of the said 10 AMCs are in \\nexistence for more than 5 years now and still have not reached break even.  \\niv. Further,  although Small AMCs at AMC level collectivel y have made profits  an \\nanalysis of data pertaining to their Mutual Fund operations alone shows that \\nSmall AMCs are making losses. Also, the data of losses from mutual fund \\noperations does not show a  definite pattern. It is seen that w hile the collective \\nlosses incurred by Smal l AMCs from their Mutual Fund operations increased \\nfrom INR 21 Crores in FY 2016 -17 to INR 167 Crores in FY 2019 -20, there \\nwas a reduction in  their collective losses to INR 6 crores in FY 2021 -22. \\n \\n4.19.  In view of the foregoing paragraphs the framework of  TER h as been reviewed \\nand certain proposals have been made keeping in view the following guiding \\nprinciples:  \\n \\ni. Transparency in Total Expenses charges to investors  \\nii. Accrual of benefit of Economies of Scale to investors  \\niii. Encourage new participants/ AMCs  \\niv. Facilitate financial inclusion  \\nv. Removing dual charges, if any, to investors  \\nvi. Addressing the likelihood of proliferation of schemes due to scheme level \\nTER \\nvii. Addressing the issue of splitting of applications, churning of investors \\nportfolio etc., for higher distribution c ommission  \\n \\n5. Issues for Public Consultation  \\n5.1. TER limit inclusive of all expenses  and charges  \\n \\ni. As mentioned at para 3.3  above, Mutual Funds are currently permitted to \\ncharge four additional type of expenses over and above the specified TER \\nlimits. The said additional expenses  had been allowed to, inter-alia, address  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 11 \\n \\nconcerns  relating to facilitating reach of Mutual Funds, concentration  of \\nInstitutional investors in MFs and to facilitate growth in the MF industry.  \\n \\nii. As mentioned at paras 4.1 – 4.6, the Mutual F und Industry has grown \\nsignificantly over the last few years with considerable increase in participation \\nof retail investors. Hence, the concerns existing at the time of introduction of \\nadditional expenses over and above the TER, may not hold true today an d \\nhence, need s a relook.  \\n \\niii. The Total Expense Ratio, as the term suggests, should , in the interest of  \\ntransparency, be inclusive of the total expenses  charged to investors at any \\npoint of time.  However, as presently  certain additional expenses are permitted  \\nto be  charged over and above the TER;  thus there is  ambiguity and  lack of \\ntransparency in the manner in which unitholders are charged by different \\nMutual Funds. Thus, it is desirable that  TER reflects the maximum expense \\nratio that an investor may have to pay and hence it should be inclusive of all \\nthe expenses permitted to be charged to an investor and the investor should \\nnot be charged any amount over and above the prescribed TER limits. \\nKeeping the said principle in view,  proposals have been made in suc ceeding \\nparas  with respect to the four additional expenses presently permitted over \\nand above TER.  \\n \\n5.1.1.  Brokerage and Transaction costs  \\n \\n5.1.1.1.  Brokerage and transaction cost s are  part of the recurring expenses that can be \\ncharged to a scheme. The additional expense limit is specified as upto 0.12 \\npercent of trade value in case of cash market transactions and 0.05 per cent of \\ntrade value in case of derivative transactions. Any payment towards brokerage \\nand transaction cost, over and above the above  mentioned transaction limits , \\nare permitted to be charged to the schemes  as recurring expenses, within the \\nmaximum limit of TER as prescribed.   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 12 \\n \\n5.1.1.2.  Following is the data regarding spending of  AMCs  towards brokerage and \\ntransaction cost s, in FY 2021 -22: \\n \\nSr. No. Particulars  No. of Mutual \\nFunds  Range of Spending \\nTowards \\nBrokerage and \\nTransaction Cost \\n(Amt. in Crores)  Total Spending \\ntowards Brokerage \\nand Transaction \\nCost (Amt. in \\nCrores)  \\n1 Large AMCs  8 60 – 524 crores  2121  \\n2 Medium AMCs  10 76- 146 crores  1066  \\n3 Small AMCs  24 0.03 – 35 crores*  279 \\n*One AMC having only Infra debt fund schemes has reported NIL expense towards \\nbrokerage and transaction cost in FY 2021 -22.  Therefore, second least cost is \\ntaken.  \\n \\n5.1.1.3.  As the prescribed  limits  for cash and derivative transactions are chargeable for \\nevery transaction carried out by a scheme, the brokerage and transaction costs \\ncharged to the investors depend on the actual number and value of \\ntransactions  undertaken by any scheme with no upper cap  being applic able on \\ntotal expenses towards such costs. As a result, there is no accountability of \\nAMCs with respect to the total spending  towards brokerage and transactions \\nfor any scheme.  \\n \\n5.1.1.4.  From the data shared by AMCs, it is observed that spending of some schemes \\ntowards brokerage and transaction cost  is more than even the maximum TER \\nlimits prescribed . This has resulted in investors paying more than double the \\npermissible  TER limits prescribed for the scheme  towards expenses.  \\n \\n5.1.1.5.  In this regard, it has been represented  by industry that bringing brokerage and \\nrelated costs within TER limits may discourage fund managers from churning \\nof portfolios, which otherwise may be in the interest of unitholders. Further, the \\nAMCs may have to take a reduction on profits owing to red uction in percentage \\nof management fees.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 13 \\n \\n5.1.1.6.  In respect of concerns regarding AMCs having to bear the brunt in the form of \\nreduced revenues, the study analysis at para 4.9 shows that weighted average \\nTER of debt funds, ETFs and index funds is much below the r egulatory limits \\nand hence, impact of keeping brokerage and transaction cost within the TER \\nlimit may be negligible. However, as most of equity schemes and hybrid \\nschemes currently charge expenses at maximum permissible TER, such \\nschemes may have an impact .  \\n \\n5.1.1.7.  While on the face of it, there may be some merit in industry’s arguments, it is \\nfelt that there is a greater need for accountability in the practices being followed \\nfor charging expenses from unitholders. It has been observed that AMCs have \\nexecuted trades through brokers who were not part of the top brokers (in terms \\nof percentage share of gross turnover of the stock exchange) and  offered  \\nservices at high brokerage costs compared to other empanelled brokers. If \\nsuch high transaction cost is for the r esearch reports, then the arrangement \\ncannot be considered as soft dollar arrangement and investors end up  paying \\ntwice for the research i.e., one which is charged as part of investment \\nmanagement and advisory fees and another which is covered under broker age \\nand transaction cost.  \\n \\n5.1.1.8.  Further, as the transaction wise brokerage and related costs presently reside \\noutside of TER, such practices of paying higher brokerage and transaction cost \\nmay not be coming under the radar or attention of Boards of AMCs. It is  felt \\nthat if transaction costs were to be made part of  TER limits, the Board s of AMC s \\nwill be bound to seek justification on practices and anomalies in this respect.  \\n \\n5.1.1.9.  In view of the above and the underlying principle that TER should be inclusive \\nof all co sts charged to an investor,  it is proposed that  brokerage and transaction \\nexpenses may be included within the TER limit and the transaction wise limits \\nprescribed for  additional  expenses towards brokerage may not be applicable. \\nThis may bring in much needed transparency in the costs charged to \\nunitholders, and greater accountability in respect of the significant brokerage \\ncosts, with oversight from the AMC Board/Trustees.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 14 \\n \\n5.1.1.10.  It has also been discussed by industry in the past that the component of \\nSecurities Transaction Tax (STT) on cash as well as derivative transactions in \\ntransaction cost, should not be part of 12 bps or 5 bps limits presently \\napplicable. However , Regulation 52 of MF Re gulations , inter-alia, envisage s all \\ncosts related to a transaction including STT to be within prescribed limits of \\nadditional charge. Thus, under the proposed framework, all expenses and \\ncosts of investment including STT, shall be within the T ER limits, as may be \\nprescribed and the cost of investment shall be expensed out (instead of being \\ncapitalis ed). \\n \\n5.1.2.  Limited purpose membership for AMCs  \\n \\n5.1.2.1.  As per extant provisions of MF Regulations, AMCs can become a proprietary \\ntrading member for carrying out  trades in the debt segment of the recognised \\nstock exchange, on behalf of its mutual fund schemes and are also permitted \\nto become a self -clearing member of the recognised clearing corporations to \\nclear and settle trades in the debt segment on behalf of i ts mutual fund \\nschemes. Considering the same and to enable AMCs to undertake their own \\ntransactions  in the equity segment of stock exchanges , it is proposed to allow \\nAMCs to obtain limited purpose membership with stock exchanges for \\nexecuting trades for ow n mutual fund schemes. This would address the issue \\ndescribed in para 5.1.1.5.  \\n \\n5.1.2.2.  In this regard, it is represented b y AMCs that availing research services of \\nprofessional stock brokers aids in better decision making by fund managers \\nand the risk management systems at brokers’ ends helps in eliminating errors.  \\n \\n5.1.2.3.  Considering AMCs charge management and advisory fees for man aging \\nscheme assets , which should ideally include cost of research for selection of \\nassets/securities for any scheme, it  is hard to understand  as to why significant \\nexpenses towards brokerage and transaction costs need to be separately \\nincurred by fund hou ses and charged to investors  in the name of research . \\nThus, charging brokerage and transaction costs which includes cost of  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 15 \\n \\nresearch  not only amounts to double charging the unitholders  but also induce \\ncertain undesirable practices, impacting interest of un itholders . \\n \\n5.1.2.4.  Therefore , brokerage and transaction cost may be within the TER limits and an \\noption for obtaining limited purpose membership may be provided to AMCs.  \\nHowever, t he choice of obtaining limited purpose membership should rest with \\nAMCs and desiro us AMCs may voluntarily undertake trading activities, which \\nwill enable  them to reduce expenses towards brokerage and transaction cost . \\nFurther, exercising this choice of obtaining limited purpose membership  shall \\nhelp in preventing instances of misuse of information and market abuse \\nincluding front running .  \\n \\n5.1.2.5.  Consultation no 1:  \\na. Whether proposals at paras 5.1.1.9  and 5.1.2. 4 are appropriate?  \\nb. Whether limited purpose membership for AMCs to execute transactions on \\nstock exchange platform , be kept voluntary or mandatory ? \\n \\n5.1.3.  Additional TER charged to the investors for distribution commission for \\ninflows from B -30 cities  \\n \\n5.1.3.1.  Mutual Funds are permitted to charge expenses not exceeding of 0.30 per cent \\nof daily net assets, if the new inflows from individual retail investors from beyond \\ntop 30 cities  (B -30 cities)  are atleast:  \\n(i) 30 per cent of gro ss new inflows in the scheme or;  \\n(ii) 15 percent of the average assets under management (year to date) of the \\nscheme, whichever is higher.  \\n \\nIf inflows from such cities is less than the higher of the above two conditions , \\nthe additional expenses on daily net assets of the scheme can be charged on \\nproportionate basis.  \\n \\n5.1.3.2.  The additional expenses charged under this provision  is to be utilised for \\ndistribution expenses incurred for br inging inflows from B-30 cities.  Thus, for \\ninflows from retail individual investors from B-30 cities , additional expense  is  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 16 \\n \\ncharged to unitholders  of regular plans of a scheme , which is thereafter utilised \\nby AMC s for payment of distribution commission.   \\n \\n5.1.3.3.  Based on the study referred to earlier and findings of inspections of Mutual \\nFunds , observations regarding  B-30 expenses charged to the investors are as \\nunder:  \\ni. The additional expen ses are not charged by AMCs to all schemes uniformly  \\nas B-30 charges are  often not included in schemes where the AMCs intend \\nto keep low expense ratio . Thus, this incentive is often used as a mechanism \\nto promote one scheme over  an another  by showing lower expenses , \\ninstead of consistently encouraging financial inclusion.  \\nii. Applic ations with investment amount higher tha n INR 2 lakhs (threshold for \\nclassification as retail  investment ) are often split to make each application \\nfor investment of  less than INR 2 lakh , so that B -30 expense s can be  \\ncharged.   \\niii. Investments of B -30 investors  are often churned by way of withdrawal  and \\nre-investment after a year  (one year is the minimum holding period \\nrequirement)  which results in  charging of additional expenses to schemes \\nfor the same investment.  \\niv. The methodology of computing additional expens es for inflows from B-30 \\ncities is not uniform across Mutual Funds.  While some fund houses  calculate \\nadditional expense based on AUM of the entire scheme and charge the \\nexpense to investors of regular plans, there are others who calculate \\nadditional expense based on AUM of only r egular plan and charge to \\ninvestors of regular p lan. \\nv. The expenses  charged  are usually  based on projections of weekly or \\nfortnightly inflows  and not on actuals which may be different from the \\nprojections .  \\n \\n5.1.3.4.  Consideri ng the above, the following is proposed.   \\ni. The additional commission to distributors may continue for inflows from B -\\n30 cities.   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 17 \\n \\nii. The distributors may be paid only for investment/inflows from new individual \\ninvestors (new PAN) from B -30 cities at the indust ry level.  \\niii. Such additional commission may be fixed at 1% of the size of the 1st \\napplication or amount committed through SIP of the individual  investor at an \\nindustry level, subject to a maximum of INR 2000/ -. \\niv. Presently, 1 basis point of daily net assets within the maximum limit of TER \\nis set aside by the AMCs for investor education and awareness initiatives.  \\nThe cost of distribution commission for inflows from B -30 cities, which results \\nin financial inclusion, may be paid from investor education and awar eness \\nexpense charged to the scheme.  Alternatively, such commission can be \\npermitted under Regulation 52 (4) of the MF Regulations  which  includes \\ndistribution commission that can be charged to the scheme.  \\nv. Any such additional commission paid to distributor should be credited back \\nto the scheme or investor education and awareness fund (as the case may \\nbe), if inflows are redeemed within a period of one year from the date of \\ninvestment.  \\nvi. Actual cost towards B -30 distribution commission should be charged to the \\nscheme and no expenses may be charged based on the projected new \\ninflows from B -30 cities.   \\nvii. The benefit of such additional commission, if opted for by AMCs, should be \\nmade applicabl e for all schemes or none.  However, exemption may be \\ngranted for schemes with duration requirement of less than 1 year (i.e. \\nOvernight Fund, Liquid Fund, Ultra Short Duration Fund and Low Duration \\nFund) as the schemes are meant for investment for shorter duration and the \\nabove proposed policy require s claw back of commission if inflows are \\nredeemed within a period of one year from the date of investment.  \\n \\n5.1.3.5.  In addition to the above, it is desirable that AMCs design their distribution \\ncommission structure/pol icy with an intent to encourage/promote financial \\ninclusion and reward inflows from B -30 cities. In this regard, AMCs can consider \\nto pay a higher  percentage of commission for inflows from B -30 cities as \\ncompared to commission for inflows from T -30 cities .  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 18 \\n \\n5.1.3.6.  Consultation no 2:  \\na. Whether the changes proposed at para 5.1.3.4 are appropriate?  \\nb. Whether the payment towards additional distributor commission be made from \\n1 bps charged to the scheme for investor education and awareness or should it \\nbe part of the distribution commission charged to the scheme?  \\nc. Should AMCs be mandated to have a policy to pay higher distribution \\ncommission for inflows from B -30 cities to promote financial inclusion?  \\n \\n5.1.4.  Additional expenses not exceeding 0.05 per cent of daily net assets due to \\ncredit of any exit load to the scheme  \\n \\n5.1.4.1.  In terms of SEBI circular dated June 30, 2009  regarding exit load charged to the \\ninvestors, a maximum of 1% of the redemption proceeds was permitted to be \\nmaintained in a separate account for payment of distrib ution commission to the \\ndistributors , other marketing /selling expenses and balance amount was required \\nto be credited back to the scheme.  \\n \\n5.1.4.2.   Pursuant to amendments to MF Regulations and circular issued there under in \\n2012, it was mandated that exit load ch arged to investors exiting from a scheme \\nshould be credited back to the scheme.  The intent behind the said amendment  \\nwas that early redemptions by investors from  the scheme has impact on the non -\\nexiting investors and thus they should be compensate d by cre diting exit load to \\nthe scheme .  In that context, AMCs were allowed to charge additional 20 bps as \\nadditional expense to the scheme.  The said additional charge , which  was \\nreduced from 20 bps to 5 bps in 2018 , was allowed for schemes where SIDs \\nhave a provision of charging of exit load .   \\n \\n5.1.4.3.  Thus, AMCs can presently charge additional 5 bps to the scheme even if there \\nis no claw back/exit load credited to the scheme. The available data of additional \\nexpenses charged to scheme s and the actual exit load s recovered from the \\ninvestors was analysed  and it is seen that in FY 2021 -22, while the total amount \\nof additional expenses charged to the schemes was INR 735 crores, the exit load  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 19 \\n \\nrecovered from exiting investors and credited to the schemes was around INR \\n611 crores.  \\n \\n5.1.4.4.  In view of the above  and considering that for more than 10 years AMCs have \\nbeen permitted to charge additional expenses, it is proposed that the provision  \\nenabling charging of additional expense of 5 bps for schemes having provision \\nof exit load , may be discontinued .  \\n \\n5.1.4.5.  Consultation no 3:  \\na. Whether the proposal for discontinuing additional charge of 5 bps charged by \\nAMCs for schemes having provision of exit load  is appropriate ? \\nb. Any other comment on the proposal ? \\n \\n5.1.5.  Goods and Service Tax  (GST)  on Investment and A dvisory Fees \\n \\n5.1.5.1.  Presently, GST on all services except for GST on I nvestment and Advisory Fees \\nis charged to the investors and is part of the total TER limits specified by SEBI. \\nGST on Investment and Advisory Fees is permitted to be charged over and \\nabove the specified TER limits.  \\n \\n5.1.5.2.  While it is agreed that GST is a statutory  indirect tax which is not under  the \\ncontrol of the AMCs, considering the overall intent of increasing trans parency in \\nexpe nses charged to u nitholders by making TER inclusive of all charges, it is \\nproposed that TER may be inclusive of GST on investment and advisory fees \\nalso.   \\n \\n5.1.5.3.  However, it is noted that this would have a significant impact on the utilization of \\nthe TER, and thus a suitable ad justment in the maximum TER  needs to  be made.  \\n \\n5.1.5.4.  Consultation no 4:  \\na. Whether the proposal at para 5.1.5.2 is appropriate?  \\nb. Any other comment  on treatment of GST on investment  and advisory fees ?  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 20 \\n \\n5.2.  Review of slab wise TER s tructure  \\n \\n5.2.1.  The slab wise TER structure in the MF Regulations has been specified to enable \\npassing of some of the benefit of economies of scale achieved by AMCs, to \\ninvestors.  While the TER slabs are presently based on the AUM of the schemes, \\nthe AMCs enjoy economies  of scale which is linked to their asset class levels \\nand not schemes. The manpower for research and other core activities of AMCs \\nmay be different for equity and debt products but every new scheme does not \\nnecessarily attract additional spending towards t he core activities by AMCs. \\nThus, while the size of the asset grows, the cost for investment may not go up in \\nthe same proportion and the same results in economies of scale  as the AUM \\ngrows significantly .  \\n \\n5.2.2.  The data presented at para 4.16  also shows that while consolidated revenue of \\nAMCs  increased by 55.27% from INR 11,397 crores to approx. INR 17,697 \\ncrores in a span of 5 years (FY 2016 -17 to 2021 -22), the profits before tax (PBT) \\nof AMCs  increased by 154%,  from 4,302 crores to 10,940 crores,  during the said \\nperiod. Further, it can be seen from the data given at para s 4.17 and 4.18  above \\nthat increase  in the profits of large AMCs was of  173% during the same period \\nFY  2016 -17 to FY 2021 -22 whereas  the increase in the profit of medium AMCs \\nwas 93.25% during the same period.   \\n \\n \\n5.2.3.  At the same time,  there is a need for AMCs of all sizes  to have an opportunity to \\ngrow. Also, an arbitrage opportunity exists between different schemes of same \\nAMC  due to scheme level slabs as n ew scheme of AMC (NFO) with small size d \\nAUM s can charge high er TER compared to the existing large schemes of AMC \\nwith big ger AUM s. As AMCs can give higher commission to distributors for NFO \\nschemes (new schemes) , this often results in switch transactions from existi ng \\nlarge AUM scheme s where average TER a scheme can be charge d is less as \\ncompared to NFO scheme where higher TER can be charged  (discussed in \\ndetail at para 5.4.3 ).  Consequently, AMCs can end up charging  higher TER \\nwithout substantial increase in AUM or number of investors .  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 21 \\n \\n5.2.4.  Further, considering the skill set required for analysing and taking decision of \\ninvestments for equity & equity related products  is different from the skill sets \\nrequired for other than  equity related products , manpower for research and other \\ncore activities of AMCs may also be different for equity products an d debt \\nproducts.   Hence, the cost required would be different.    \\n \\n5.2.5.  Considering the above, the following is proposed – \\ni. The TER slabs should be at the level  of the AMC  and not at the scheme \\nlevel.  \\nii. AUM of open -ended schemes, wherein slab based TER is presently \\napplicable, may be bucketed into Equity based AUM (equity  & equity related \\ninstruments ) and other than equity based AUM of the AMC (other than equity \\n& equity related instruments).  \\niii. Since Overnight funds of AMCs invest in securities with maturity of 1 day, \\nwhich includes overnight repos, TREPS etc., the AUM of such schemes  may \\nnot be considered in any of the above referred buckets for the purpose of \\ncalculation of TER.  However, TER rate derived based on all  investments \\nother than equity  & equity related product shall be the maximum TER for \\nOvernight funds also.  \\n \\n5.2.6.  Consultation no 5:  \\na) Whether the proposal to replace scheme based slab structure with AMC \\nlevel AUM based slabs  is appropriate?  \\nb) Whether the proposal to segregate slabs based on underlying investment by \\nequity and other than equity products  is appropriate?  \\nc)  Any other comment on the proposals made at para 5.2.5 ? \\n \\n5.3. Revised TER l imits  \\n \\n5.3.1.  As mentioned at paras above, limits on TER are proposed to be kept at AMC \\nlevel and inclusive of all costs and expenses including GST on management \\nfees, brokerage  and transac tion costs, B -30 incentive etc . Considering that 20% \\nof the AMCs are presently managing around 75% of the i ndustry AUM and many  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 22 \\n \\nof the  small AMCs continue to be  loss making entities,  the revised TER slabs are \\nproposed ensuring small AMCs are not at a disadvantage,  and to encourage \\ncompetition amongst AMCs of all sizes , which will be in the interest of investors .    \\n \\n5.3.2.  Further,  as discussed at above paras, the  economies of scale of the MF industry \\nare linked to the ir asset class levels and not scheme levels .  In view of the same , \\nseparate slabs  have been  proposed for equity & equity related  instruments and \\ninstruments other than equity & equity related instruments .  \\n \\n5.3.3.  The revised slabs are proposed with higher TER limits so as to cover all costs \\nand expenses  including GST on management fees. Accordingly, AMC level \\nslabs for equity based AUM of schemes (investment in equity & equity related \\ninstruments) are proposed as specified below:  \\nSr. \\nNo AMC level AUM  (in INR)  Equity & Equity Oriented Instruments  \\n(Maximum TER for Regular Plan)  Weighted Average TER \\nchargeable at the upper \\nlimit of the AMC level \\nAUM  (Maximum TER \\nfor Regular Plan) * \\n1 Upto INR 2,500 Crores  2.55% 2.55%  \\n2 On the next INR 2,500 \\nCrores  2.45% 2.50%  \\n3 On the next INR 5,000 \\nCrores  2.30%  2.40%  \\n3 On the next INR 40,000 \\ncrores of the daily net \\nassets (Upto INR 50,000 \\nCrores)  \\n Reduction of 0.05% for every increase of \\nINR 5,000 Crores of daily net assets or \\npart thereof of the AUM of equity & equity \\nrelated instruments.   2.14%  \\n4 On the next INR 50,000 \\ncrores of the daily net \\nassets (Upto INR 1,00,000 \\nCrores)  \\n Reduction of 0 .10% for every increase of \\nINR 10,000 Crores of daily net assets or \\npart thereof of the AUM of equity & equity \\nrelated instruments.   1.87% \\n5 On balance of the assets  1.30 Depends on the AUM   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 23 \\n \\n* Rates given are for Regular Plan.  TER of Direct Plan will be TER charged to Regular Plan minus \\ndistribution commission.  \\n  \\n5.3.4.  Further, TER slabs for AUM of other than equity based AUM (investment in other \\nthan equity & equity related instruments),  but excluding the AUM of overnight \\nscheme s, are  proposed as under : \\nSr. \\nNo. AMC level AUM  (in INR)  Max. TER for Other \\nthan Equity & Equity \\nrelated Instruments  Weighted Average  TER \\nchargeable at the upper limit \\nof the AMC level AUM * \\n1 Upto INR 5,000 Crores  1.20%  1.20%  \\n2 On the next INR 25,000  Crores  1.10%  1.12%  \\n3 On the next INR 30,000 Crores  1.00%  1.06%  \\n4 On balance of the assets  0.9%  Depends on the AUM  \\n* Rates given are for Regular Plan.  TER of Direct Plan will be TER charged to Regular Plan minus \\ndistribution commission.  \\n \\n5.3.5.  In view of the slabs proposed above, the TER slab for active mutual fund \\nschemes will be based on the investments of schemes in equity & equity related \\ninstruments and other than equity & equity related instruments. For example, if \\nthe value of investments in equity & equity related instruments of active schemes \\nis INR 24,000 crores and value of investment of other than equity & equity related \\ninstruments of active schemes excluding AUM of  Overnight Fund is INR 80,000 \\ncrores, then TER of any plan of equity schemes cannot be more than 2.2 9% and \\nTER of all plans of debt schemes cannot be more than 1.0 2% in view of the \\nbelow given formula:  \\n \\n TER  of any Equity  scheme  =2500 ∗0.0255 +2500 ∗0.0245 +5000 ∗0.0230 +5000 ∗0.0225 +5000 ∗0.0220 +4000 ∗0.0215 )∗100\\n24000  =2.29%  \\n \\nTER  of any Debt  scheme  =5000 ∗0.012 +25000 ∗0.011 +30000 ∗0.01+20000 ∗0.009 )∗100  \\n 80,000 =1.02%  \\n \\n5.3.6.  For Hybrid and Solution oriented scheme s, TER of equity & equity related \\ninstruments  as derived based on the above given methodology  is to be applied \\nfor equity portion of AUM of scheme s and on the remaining AUM of the scheme , \\nthe TER for other than equity & equity related instruments may be applied.  Thus, \\nTER of  the Hybrid and Solution Oriented scheme s shall be the weighted average  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 24 \\n \\nof TER of equity & equity related instruments and TER of other than equity & \\nequity related instruments.   \\n \\n5.3.7.  Based on  an impact analysis of the above proposed slabs, it is seen that there \\nwould be a benefit of reduced expenses for investors of equity, hybrid and \\nsolution oriented schemes.  Further , as per the analysis it is seen that the impact \\nof the revised slabs for debt schemes, even after adding all cost of AMCs towards \\nadditional expenses, woul d be minimal. As per the proposed slabs  at para 5.3.3 , \\nthe maximum TER for equity schemes shall not be above 2.55% .  Therefore , \\nschemes charging TER of more than 2.55%, as seen from the data at para 4.11 \\nabove  will have to reduce the total effective TER.   For instance,  a scheme \\ncharging the weighted average TER of 2.78% will need to reduce its TER to \\n2.55%, an effective reduction of 8% of the extant TER.  \\n \\n5.3.8.  Further, t he impact of the revised slabs of TER on AMCs  collectively , which in \\nturn would result  in reduction in expenses of equity, hybrid and solution oriented \\nschemes for investors can be seen in the below given table:  \\n \\nTotal Expenses  charged during FY \\n– 2021 -22 (Amt. in Crores)  Total Expenses chargeable based \\non revised slabs * (Amt. in Crores)  Impact  at industry \\nlevel  \\n30,806  29,404 4.55% \\n*total expenses  chargeable  include s expenses for direct plan plus regular plan .   \\n \\n5.3.9.  In order to understand the impact of revised TER on investors, the change in \\ncalculation of TER of equity oriented open ended schemes can be understood \\nfrom the below given example -   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 25 \\n \\nA B C   D E \\nScheme  Weighted Average TER \\n(including all additional \\nexpenses) charged to \\nregular investors  Maximum TER \\nchargeable with New \\nProposed Slabs to \\nRegular plan  Difference in current TER \\ncharged vs revised permissible \\nTER of the scheme  \\n(B–C)  Change in \\nTER \\n(D/B*100) \\nAMC - A 1.80%  1.64%  0.16%  8.89%  \\nAMC – B 1.75%  1.63%  0.12%  6.86%  \\nAMC – C 2.02%  1.62%  0.40%  19.80%  \\nAMC - D 2.10%  1.83%  0.27%  12.86%  \\nAMC - E 1.86%  1.85%  0.01%  0.54%  \\n \\n5.3.10.   The proposed new methodology of calculation of TER would bring about \\ntransparency and reduction in cost of investment in mutual funds for the investors  \\nbased on economies of scale . Pursuant to the last review of TER (i.e. in 2018) \\nthere has been a considerable increase in the AUM of the industry  (almost 2 \\ntimes) .  In view of the proposed  benefits of limited purpose membership of the \\nstock exchange for the AMCs coupled with the increasing AUM of the industry, \\nthe impact of the revised slabs may be mitigated  to a large extent .   \\n \\n5.3.11.  Further, in the above given paras the revision in TER is propo sed for Active Open \\nEnded schemes and no change is proposed for TER of passive schemes  (Index \\nFunds and ETFs) .  \\n \\nGlide Path  \\n5.3.12.  For the proposals at para 5.1.1.9, 5.1.2.4, 5.1.3.4 (iv), 5.1.5.2 and 5.3 a time \\nperiod of six months from the date of notification of Regulation / issuance of \\nCircular may be given to AMCs as a glide path for compliance.  Further, the \\nrevised policy on benefit to distributors for B -30 investments, as detailed  at para \\n5.1.3.4  above,  is proposed to be made applicable  from t he date of notification of \\nRegulation / issuance of Circular  in this regard .  \\n \\n5.3.13.  Consultation  no 6:  \\na. Whether the proposed TER slabs for investment in equity & equity related \\ninstruments and for other  than equity & equity  related instruments  is \\nappropriate?   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 26 \\n \\nb. Whether the method ology  proposed to arrive at TER for Hybrid and Solution \\nOriented schemes  is appropriate?  \\nc. Whether the glide path for AMCs proposed at para 5.3.1 2 above is \\nappropriate?  \\nd. Any other comment on the proposal ? \\n \\n5.4. Other Proposals:  \\n5.4.1.  Commission/fees paid to distributors  \\n \\n5.4.1.1.  In terms of SEBI Circular no. CIR/IMD/DF/13/2011 dated August 22, 2011, \\nAMCs are presently permitted to deduct transaction charges of INR 100/- for \\nexisting investors in a Mutual Fund and INR 150/- for first time investor in Mutual \\nFund per subscription of INR 10,000/ - and above from the subscription amount \\nof the investor.  The amount deduced as transaction charges is paid to the \\ndistributor.  \\n \\n5.4.1.2.  Further, the above circular provides for payment of an  upfront commission by \\ninvestors dir ectly to distributors, based on investor’s assessment of various \\nfactors including the services rendered by a distributor.   \\n \\n5.4.1.3.  In view of the overall proposal that all expenses should be included in the \\nprescribed TER and considering that  the distributors b eing agents of AMCs \\nshould be entitled to remuneration for services rendered only from AMCs, it is \\nproposed that payment of upfront commission by investor directly and \\ntransaction costs deductible from investments  of investors , may not be \\npermitted.  \\n \\n5.4.1.4.  The measures proposed at para 5.4.1.3 may be made applicable from the date \\nof notification of Regulation / issuance of Circular . \\n \\n5.4.1.5.  Consultation no 7  \\na. Whether the measure s proposed at para 5.4.1.3  are appropriate?   \\nb. Any other comment on the proposal ?  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 27 \\n \\n \\n5.4.2.  Expense Ratio of Fund of Fund (FoF) Scheme s \\n \\n5.4.2.1.  Under the extant provisions for FoF schemes, the TER charged is based on the \\nTER of the underlying scheme. It is specified that for FoF schemes the TER to \\nbe charged over and above the weighted average of the to tal expense ratio of \\nthe underlying scheme(s)cannot exceed two times the weighted average of the \\ntotal expense ratio levied by the  underlying scheme(s), subject to the overall \\nceiling.  \\n \\n5.4.2.2.  In this regard, it has been  represented  by some industry  participants that \\ninternational funds with large AUM have a low cost structure  and thus I ndian \\nAMCs are often left with l ess room to charge desired TER for managing \\ninvestments in such international FOFs. Further, AMCs are also required to pay \\nlicensing fees for using an overseas benchmark. Thus, it leads to relatively high -\\ncost international funds being sold to Indian investors instead of low cost \\nefficient funds, which is not in the best interests of investors.  \\n \\n5.4.2.3.  In view of the above and to facilitate AMCs to launch F oFs on low cost \\ninternational funds, it is proposed that for schemes investing only in international \\nfunds , the TER over and above the weighted average of the TER of the \\nunderlying scheme (s) shall not exceed higher of  two times the weighted average \\nof the TER levied by the underlying scheme(s) and the actual cost of running a \\nscheme  including distribution commission of not more than 50 bps but excluding \\nAMC Management Fees , subject to the overall regulatory limit.  \\n \\n5.4.2.4.  The measures proposed at para 5.4.2.3 may be made applicable from the date \\nof notification of Regulation / issuance of Circular .   \\n \\n5.4.2.5.  Consultation no 8 \\na) Whether the measures proposed at para 5.4.2.3  are appropriate?  \\nb) Any other comment on the proposal ? \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 28 \\n \\n5.4.3.  Switch Transactions and Distributor Commission  \\n \\n5.4.3.1.  The data regarding NFOs during the period from April 01, 2021 to September \\n30, 2022 , is as under:  \\nParticulars  Active Schemes  Passive Schemes  Total  \\nNFOs during the period  47 39 86 \\nAmount garnered (INR Crores)  82,733  2,552  85,285  \\nAmount garnered through Switch  \\n(Regular Plan) (INR Crores)  22,437  386 22,823  \\nAmount garnered through switch \\n(Direct Plan) (INR Crores)  1,206  302 1,508  \\nPercentage of amount garnered \\nthrough switch by distributors \\n(Regular Plan)  27.12%  15.12%  26.76%  \\n \\n5.4.3.2.  The following is observed from the above data:  \\ni. Switch transactions in regular plans amounted to INR 22,823 crores i.e. 93% of \\ntotal switch transactions. No such pattern of switch was seen in case of \\ninvestments through direct plans.  \\nii. The amount garnered by new active schemes was INR 82,733, out of whic h INR \\n22,437 crores i.e. 27.12% of the amount garnered, was through switch \\ntransactions from regular plans of other schemes of the same AMC.  \\niii. In one of the schemes, upto 55% of the fund garnered in NFO was through \\nswitch transactions from other schemes of the Mutual Fund.  \\n \\n5.4.3.3.  Under the present provisions, owing to scheme level slab based TER structure, \\na new scheme with small size of AUM is able to charge higher TER as compared \\nto an existing scheme with higher AUM.  Thus, AMCs can be motivated to give \\nhigh d istribution commission for new NFO schemes wherein it can charge high \\nTER and nudge the switch transactions from existing schemes with large size \\nAUM to the new schemes with smaller AUM size.  It can be seen from the above \\ngiven data that the switches to N FO were mainly in regular plans i.e.  through \\ndistributors.    \\n \\n \\n   Page | 29 \\n \\n \\n5.4.3.4.  Thus, having higher distribution commission structures for NFOs as compared \\nto existing schemes  may induce  some distributors to churn their investors’ \\nportfolios or mis -sell investment products for higher commissions, which is not \\ndesirable.  Further, it is understood that the trail commissions paid by AMCs is \\noften higher in the first /initial year(s) of inflows/investments and reduces in \\nsubsequent years.  This practice of paying lower trail co mmissions after initial \\nyears of investments also encourages churning and/or mis -selling of products \\nby distributors after the first year of investments.  \\n \\n5.4.3.5.  Vide circular dated October 22, 2018, SEBI has mandated MFs/ AMCs to adopt \\na full trail model for di stributor commission i.e, without payment of any upfront \\ncommission or up fronting of any trail commission, directly or indirectly, in cash \\nor kind, through sponsorships, or any route.  The abovementioned instances of \\npayment s of commission in  the first ye ar of investment/inflows results in an \\nupfronting of the trail commission.  \\n \\n5.4.3.6.  The following table gives an analysis of redemptions that took place in FY 2021 -\\n22 and FY 2022 -23:  \\nSr. No  Period  % of units of Regular \\nPlan sold/redeemed in \\nthe given period - FY \\n2021 -22 % of units of Regular Plan \\nsold/redeemed in the given \\nperiod - FY 2022 -23  \\n1 0 - 1 years  56.83%  50.11%  \\n2 1 – 2 years  15.14%  23.04%  \\n3 2 – 3 years  5.03%  9.81%  \\n4 3 – 5 years  20.41%  13.96%  \\n5 More than 5 years  2.59%  3.09%  \\n \\nThe above data shows that during FY 202 1-22, around 71% of the total Mutual \\nFund units were redeemed within 2 years of investment.  Similarly, during FY \\n2022 -23, 73% of units were redeemed within 2 years of investment .  Only \\ninvestments in 3% of the units continued for more than 5 years.     \\n \\n \\n   Page | 30 \\n \\n \\n5.4.3.7.  In view of the above and to discourage churning / mis -selling by distributors, it \\nis proposed as under:  \\na. In the case of a switch transaction, the distributor  shall be entitled to lower of \\nthe commissions offered under the two schemes of any switch transaction.   For \\nexample, if the distribution commission offered by AMC for  Scheme A is 1%, \\nScheme B is 1.5% and Scheme C is 2% the entitlement of commission for \\nswitch t ransaction will be as under :   \\nSr. No.  Scenario  Commission Payable  \\n1 Switch from A to B  1% \\n2 Switch from C to B  1.5%  \\n3 Switch from A to B   then from B to C  1%  \\n4 Switch from C to A  1% \\n \\nb. Mandate one of the following:  \\ni. The commission to distributor should  be in increasing trend with the first \\nyear’s commission not being more than 25% committed to the distributor \\nfor first three years, OR  \\nii. The commission paid to distributor should  be equal for all years.  \\n \\n5.4.3.8.  The measures proposed at para 5.4. 3.7 (a) may b e made applicable from the \\ndate notific ation of R egulation / issuance of Circular .  Regarding the proposal at \\npara 5.4.3.7 (b), three -month time may be given to AMCs from the date \\nnotification of R egulation / issuance of Circular , for compliance.  \\n \\n5.4.3.9.  Consultation no 9 : \\na. Whether the measures proposed  at para 5.4.3.7  are appropriate?  \\nb. Whether the glide path proposed at para 5.4.3.8 is appropriate?  \\nc. Any other suggestions for reduction of churning / mis -selling due to  \\nvariable trail commission models?  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 31 \\n \\n5.4.4.  Exit Load  \\n \\n5.4.4.1.  MF Regulations presently states that the repurchase price of units of an open \\nended scheme shall not be lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value \\n(“NAV”).  This enables Mutual Fund schemes to charge exit load of upto 5% to \\ninvestors , which gets credited back to the scheme. The  maximum permissible  \\nexit load was revised from 7% of the NAV to 5% in March 2021.  \\n \\n5.4.4.2.  SEBI has received representations that AMCs can charge high exit load s even \\nwhen  a scheme does not perform  well and the value of investment goes  down. \\nIn this regard, it cannot be denied  that the early redemption by investors from \\nthe scheme has impact on the non -exiting investors and exit load discourages \\nearly exit from the scheme. Also, i t is observed that Mutual Funds generally \\ncharge one to two percent as exit load. In view of the same  and considering that \\nexit load is credited back to the scheme , it is proposed that the exit load of an \\nopen ended scheme may be lowered to  a maximum permissible  limit of 2%.  \\n \\n5.4.4.3.  The propos al may be made applicable with immediate effect, from the date of \\nnotification of Regulation / issuance of Circular .  \\n \\n5.4.4.4.  Consultation no 10 :   \\na. Whether the maximum permissible e xit load may be reduced from 5% to 2 %? \\nb. Any other comment  on the issue of charging exit load?  \\n \\n5.4.5.  Issue and Redemption expenses of the scheme  \\n \\n5.4.5.1.  The expenses that can be charged to Mutual Fund schemes are laid down in \\nRegulation s 52(2) and 52(4) of the MF Regulations.  Further, Regulation 52(5) \\nclarifies that any expenses other than those specified in the Regulations 52(2) \\nand 52(4) , shall be borne by the AMC or Trustee or Sponsors.  \\n \\n5.4.5.2.  To provide  better  clarity, it is proposed that MF Regulations may be \\nappropriately amended to state that any expense other than those specified in  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 32 \\n \\nRegulations 52(2) and 52(4)  of MF Regulations , including initial expenses of \\nlaunching schemes, shall be borne by the AMC or T rustees or Sponsors.  \\n \\n5.4.5.3.  Further, AMCs are presently permitted to charge winding up costs for \\nterminating a fund or a scheme.  The proceeds of sale realised from disposal of \\nthe assets of the scheme under winding up is to be first utilised towards \\ndischarging  of such liabilities that are due and payable under the scheme and \\nafter making appropriate provision for meeting the expenses connected with \\nsuch winding up.  \\n \\n5.4.5.4.  In this regard, it has been argued in the past that mutual fund distributors are \\nentitled to pa yment of commission (trail commission)  agreed between  \\ndistributors  and AMC  before the announcement of winding up of the scheme , \\nas the expense is in the nature of recurring expense  as per Regulation 52 of MF \\nRegulations.   \\n \\n5.4.5.5.  In this regard, Hon’ble Supreme Court in its order dated August 12, 2022 has \\nheld that if and only when recurring expenses mentioned under Regulation 52 \\n(4)(b) of the MF Regulations fall under and meet the requirement of the \\nexpenses connected with the winding up can  they be allowed unde r Regulation  \\n41(2)(b)  of the MF Regulations . Such expenses are allowed not because of \\nclause (b) to Regulation 52(4), but because the expenses incurred would satisfy \\nthe requirement of being connected with such winding up under Regulation \\n41(2)(b).  \\n \\n5.4.5.6.  In view of the same, it is proposed to amend the MF Regulations to clarify that \\nafter the announcement of winding -up of the scheme, unless the decision is \\nreversed by the investors, the expenses charged to the scheme/investors shall \\nbe restricted to such r ecurring expenses permitted under Regulation 52(4)(b) , \\nwhich pertain to winding up of a scheme.  \\n \\n5.4.5.7.  The proposal may be made applicable from the date of notification of Regulation \\n/ issuance of Circular .  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 33 \\n \\n5.4.5.8.  Consultation no 11  \\na. Whether  the proposed clarifications  at paras 5.4.5.2 an d 5.4.5.6  are \\nappropriate?  \\nb. Any other comment on the proposed changes?  \\n \\n5.4.6.  Performance based TER  \\n5.4.6.1.  As per the extant industry practice, irrespective of the performance of a scheme \\n(relative to its Benchmark) the AMCs are charging the management fees and \\nexpenses on a daily basis. An analysis of the data of performance of active \\nschemes over a period of 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years  as on February \\n2023,  indicates the following:  \\nScheme Performance vis-\\nà-vis Benchmark  Number of Schemes (Active Schemes)  \\n1 Year Return  3 Year Return  5 Year Return  10 Years Return  \\nDirect  Regular  Direct  Regular  Direct  Regular  Direct  Regular  \\nMore than 1.25% of \\nunderperformance to the \\nBenchmark  17.23%  25.75%  26.70%  37.57%  26.22%  40.30%  10.18%  22.80%  \\nUpto  1.25 % (equivalent \\nto max. tracking \\ndifference permissible for \\ndebt ETFs/Index Funds) \\nof underperformance to \\nthe Benchmark  26.04%  32.24%  25.78%  29.71%  29.01%  33.04%  23.53%  37.74%  \\n% of Schemes meeting \\nthe Benchmark  or \\nOutperforming  56.73%  42.01%  47.53%  32.72%  44.77%  26.67%  66.29%  39.46%  \\n \\n5.4.6.2.  From the above, it is observed that underperformance of regular plans of \\nschemes is higher as compared to direct plan s.  Further, more than 22% of the \\nregular plans of schemes have underperformance of more than 1.25% \\n(equivalent to max. tracking difference permissible for debt ETFs/Index Funds) \\nvis-à-vis the benchmark for all periods mentioned above.  \\n \\n5.4.6.3.  The above table gives comparison of the performance of active schemes vis-à-\\nvis performance of respective benchmark s.  In this regard, it can be argued that \\ngiven that there are certain constrain ts applicable to Mutual Fund schemes \\nwhich are not applicable  to the benchmark s, replication of benchmarks ’ \\nperformance may not always be possible.  Even in case of passive schemes  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 34 \\n \\nsuch as ETFs/ Index fund s, which replicate the relevant benchmark s, there may \\nbe variance between the performance of the schemes and the benchmarks. The \\nunderperformance of schemes can be to an exte nt attributed to the following \\nfactors/constrain ts which the benchmark does not have : \\n \\na. Sectoral, issuer level investment limits for Mutual Fund s chem es \\nb. Scheme expenses (TER)   \\nc. Transaction, liquidity, impact cost  \\nd. Cost of r ebalancing of portfolio due to daily investment and redemptions  \\nin the scheme  \\n \\n5.4.6.4.  Notwithstanding the above , any significan t underperformance of the fund versus \\nits benchmark is not in the  interest of unitholder s. Further, AMCs outperforming \\nthe market may find merit in charging unitholders with performance linked TER , \\nwherein the management fee is based on scheme performance.  Thus, the \\nconcept of variable TER based on performance of the sc hemes can be explored \\nand accordingly, views on the same are sought in this paper.  \\n \\n5.4.6.5.  To start with, performance linked TER can be enabled for active open ended \\nequity schemes wherein AMCs can charge higher management fees if the \\nscheme performance is more than an indicative  return above the tracking \\ndifference adjusted benchmark  (Tracking difference adjusted benchmark \\nmeans b enchmark returns adjusted for permissible  operational cost of \\nmanaging the fund ). Alternatively , AMC can be permitted to charge h igher \\nmanagement fee  based on a pre -decided  hurdle rate  as may be disclosed in the \\nSIDs. Such higher management fees  under both models  can be either at a fixed \\nrate or on returns  sharing basis.  \\n \\n5.4.6.6.  In such cases, the base expense ratio ( for Direct and Regular  plans) can be at \\nTER limits as applicable for passive schemes , which are lower than active \\nschemes .  \\n \\n5.4.6.7.  Approach A:  During the period in which  the investor remains invested,  the base \\nexpense ratio may be charged to the investor. At the time of redemption, t he  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 35 \\n \\nmanagement fees may be charged if return of more than indicative rate is \\ngenerated or annu alised returns received by the i nvestor is above the hurdle \\nrate. The maximum management fees may also be specified to discourage fund \\nmanagers from taking imprude nt risk in order to  earn higher  fees. The NAV paid \\nout at the time of redemption may be netted  for the management fees and the \\nbalance amount may be paid to the investor.  \\n \\n5.4.6.8.  Approach B:  There can be another approach where higher expense limit for \\nperformance based TER may be fixed and TER inclusive of management fees \\nis charged to the investor.  The TER charged by the scheme s in such cases \\nshould be based on the schemes’ performance during the previous year. At the \\ntime of redemption by the investor , if AMC fails to generate  return  above the \\nindicative  returns  for investor or the annualised returns for the investor is below \\nthe hurdle rate fixed in advance , the AMC may retain base TER as may be \\napplicable and return the remaining expenses charged to the investor, along \\nwith the redemption amount.  \\n \\n5.4.6.9.  It will be optional to the AMCs to offer such a scheme(s). Further, a s \\nperformance based TER is a new concept  for the Indian Mutual Fund industry, \\nat this stage, it is proposed  to test the model under the Regulatory Sandbox.  \\n \\n5.4.6.10.  Consultation no 12  \\na. Whether Mutual Funds should be provided with an option to have schemes with \\nperformance based TER?  \\nb. If yes, s hould it be allowed on a voluntary basis or made mandatory?  \\nc. If yes, which of above mentioned approaches (A or B) should be adopted?  \\nd. Any other comment regarding Performance based TER ? \\n \\n5.4.7.  Financial inclusion of women in Mutual Fund space  \\n \\n5.4.7.1.  The data for statement of account  folios of individual in vestors in mutual fund \\nindustry indicates that out of total folios, approx. 25% of folios belong to only \\nwomen investors and approx. 16% of the folios are in the joint holding wherein  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 36 \\n \\none holder is a woman. Thus, there is a considerable scope for gender in clusion \\nin the Mutual Fund space, which requires the industry to create awareness and \\npromote financial inclusion amongst women . \\n \\n5.4.7.2.  There have been initiatives taken by State G overnments  towards encouraging \\ninvestment s by women in house property , by providin g waiver of certain \\npercentage of registration charges if the house property is in the name of a \\nwom an.  Also, some banks offer lower home loan rates to women  borrowers . \\nSince investment products need effective selling, in order to encourage Mutual \\nFunds to reach out to more women investors, the following is proposed:  \\n \\ni. An additional incentive may be introduced for distributors for new \\ninvestments/inflows from women investors (new PAN) at the industry level.    \\nii. In case of joint holding, the additional incentive may be for inflows wherein 1st \\nholder is a wom an investor and the said woma n investor is new (new PAN) at \\nthe industry level.  \\niii. Such additional commission to distributors may be fixed at 1% of the investment \\namount of the 1st application or amount committed through SIP of the woma n \\ninvestor at industry level, subject to a maximum of INR 2000/ - per investor.  \\niv. Presently, 1 basis point of the daily net assets within the maximum limit of TER \\nis set aside by the AMCs for investor education and awareness initiatives.  The \\ncost of the proposed additional distribution commission for first time investment \\nby a woman in vestor, which results in financial inclusion, may be paid from \\ninvestor education and awareness expense charged to the scheme.  \\nAlternatively, such distribution commission can be permitted to be charged \\nunder Regulation 52 (4) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulat ions, 1996  which  \\nincludes distribution commission that can be charged to the scheme.  \\nv. Any such additional commission paid to distributor should be credited back to \\nthe scheme or investor education and awareness fund (as the case may be), if \\ninflows are rede emed within a period of one year from the date of investment , \\nas done for distribution commission of inflows from B -30 cities . \\nvi. Actual cost towards distribution commission should be charged to the scheme.   \\n \\n \\n   Page | 37 \\n \\nvii. Such additional commission  should be made applicable  for all schemes  of an \\nAMC  except for schemes with duration requirement of less than 1 year (i.e. \\nOvernight Fund, Liquid Fund, Ultra Short Duration Fund and Low Duration \\nFund) as the schemes are meant for investment for shorter duration and the \\nabove propo sed policy require s claw back of commission if inflows are \\nredeemed within a period of one year from the date of investment . \\nviii. As similar incentive is also available for B -30 investors, it shall have to be \\nensured by AMCs that the proposed incentive for women investors is extended \\nonly in those cases where B -30 incentive is not given.  \\n \\n5.4.7.3.  AMCs may be granted two months  from the date of notification  of Regulation / \\nissuance of Circular for compliance with the above proposed pol icy.  \\n \\n5.4.7.4.  Consultation no 13  \\na. Whether additional incentive should be introduced for encouraging financial \\ninclusion of women investors in Mutual Funds?  \\nb. If yes, are the proposed measures appropriate?  \\nc. Any other suggestions for encouraging financial inclusion of women investors in \\nMutual Funds?  \\nd. Whether the glide path proposed at para 5.4.7.3 is appropriate?  \\n \\n5.4.8.  Increase in Total Expense Ratio  of locked -in and quasi locked -in schemes  \\n \\n5.4.8.1.  In terms of the ext ant regulatory provision s, any change in the base TER in \\ncomparison to previous base TER charged to any scheme/plan is to be \\ncommunicated to investors of the scheme/plan through notice via email or SMS \\nat least three working days prior to effecting such change . Further, the notice of \\nchange in base TER is to be updated on the website of the AMC at least three \\nworking days prior to effecting such change.  \\n \\n5.4.8.2.  In this regard, it is proposed that unitholders may be given an option to exit at \\nthe prevailing NAV withou t any exit load when there is  an increase in TER.   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 38 \\n \\n5.4.8.3.  Further, for schemes where investment of investors is  under a  lock-in or quasi \\nlock-in (such as under ELSS scheme s, Close Ended schemes  and also for \\nTarget Maturity scheme wherein investment is intended to be held till maturity \\nto mitigat e interest rate risk  and getting projected yield on maturity ), the TER \\nmay not be increased for the existing investors.  A ny increase in TER of \\nschemes (ELSS and Target Maturity funds) may be applicable only for new \\ninvestments and the existing investment s in such scheme s shall be \\ngrandfathered.   \\n \\n5.4.8.4.  However, any such exit to investor s or grandfathering of investment s may not \\nbe required if  the increase in TER of a Mutual Fund scheme is as per the \\nregulatory requirement due to change in AUM.  \\n \\n5.4.8.5.  The above proposal may be made applicable from the date of notification of \\nRegulation / issuance of Circular .  \\n \\n5.4.8.6.  Consultation  no 14: \\na. Whether investor should be provided exit without exit load on increase in TER \\nby AMC?  \\nb. Whether the proposal of grandfathering of existing investment s in locked -\\nin/quasi locked -in schemes on increase in TER rate is appropriate?  \\nc. Any other comment  on the proposal ? \\n \\n5.4.9.  TER of Regular and Direct plans  \\n \\n5.4.9.1.  Direct plans were mandated by SEBI from January 01, 2013 wherein \\ninvestments are not routed through a distributor.  Regarding TER of direct plan, \\nit has been stated that direct plan shall have a lower expense ratio excluding \\ndistribution expenses, commissi on, etc., and no commission shall be paid from \\nsuch plans.  It is also clarified that that all fees and expenses charged in a direct \\nplan (in percentage terms) under various heads including the investment and \\nadvisory fee shall not exceed the fees and expe nses charged under such heads \\nin a regular plan.   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   Page | 39 \\n \\n5.4.9.2.  It is understood that the TER charged to investors is based on estimations and \\nactual expense may be higher or lower than the estimated cost.  Consequently, \\nif higher investment and advisory fees are charged to regular plan as compared \\nto direct plan , for the same service , it may not be in the interest of investors of \\nregular plan.  The issue of difference in actual and estimated cost charged to \\ninvestors can be addressed by increasing the frequenc y of reconciliation of TER \\nand crediting back the difference of accrued cost vs actual cost, if any, to the \\nrespective plan at the end of the financial year /fixed frequency  e.g. \\nweekly/monthly .  \\n \\n5.4.9.3.  In view of the above, it is proposed that there should be uniformity in charging \\nof each and every expense  to the investor of regular plan and direct plan and \\nthe only difference between the TER of regular plan and direct plan should be \\nthe expenses toward s distribution commission .    \\n \\n5.4.9.4.  The above proposal may be made applicable from the date of notification of \\nRegulation / issuance of Circular .  \\n \\n5.4.9.5.  Consultation  no 15: \\na. Whether the proposal of  uniformity  in charging of each and every expense to the \\ninvestor of regular plan and direct plan (other than distribution commission) is \\nappropriate?  \\nb. Any other comment on the proposal?  \\n \\n6. Public Comments  \\n6.1. Considering the implications of the said matter on the market participants, \\npublic comments are invited  on the above proposals.   \\n \\n6.2. Comments may be sent by email to Ms. Manaswini Mahapatra, General \\nManager ( manaswinim@sebi.gov.in ), Mr. Peter Mardi, Deputy General \\nManager ( peterm@sebi.gov.in ) and Ms. Laxmi Rampurawala, Assistant \\nGeneral Manager  (laxmir@sebi.gov.in )  latest by June 0 1, 2023.
